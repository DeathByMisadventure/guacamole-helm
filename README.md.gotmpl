# Guacamole Helm Chart

This helm chart will deploy pairs of guacamole and guacd containers in Kubernetes for remote access into the environment.

## Prerequisites

* The Postgresql server for guacamole must be deployed into the environment.
* AKS nodes must be able to reach the subnets the VMs are deployed in to.

## Configure values.yaml or valuesoverride.yaml

A few variables need to be created in the values.yaml.  Namely postgresql connection information, OpenID, and if a custom root certificate will be used.

## Deployment

Create a namespace:  `kubectl create ns guacamole`

Add the secret for the certificate if using an ingress

Install the helm chart with:  `helm install --namespace guacamole guacamole .`
